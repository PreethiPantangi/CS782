Sequential RecSys is an open-Source PyTorch based library, inspired by the structure of the widely used Scikit-learn library. The library encompasses three essential sequential recommendation algorithms: SASRec (Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation), Caser (Personalized Top-N Sequential Recommendation via Convolutional Sequence Embedding), and Bert4Rec (Sequential Recommendation with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer). In addition to facilitating loading and pre-processing the data, the library will incorporate a ranking-based recommendation evaluation module, featuring Hit@k and NDCG@k metrics.
